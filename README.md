### The README for robotics systems. ###

__TODO__
- [x] Setup git
- [x] Setup overleaf doc, link when done: https://www.overleaf.com/4863979513zbkvhxdvsqpd 
- [x] Check how infrared module works
- [x] Create baseline solution
- [ ] Create alternate baseline (constantly rotating)
- [x] Calibrate Sensors
- [ ] Do baseline experiment, Create some way of calculating accuracy. (Some way of storying theta and measurement) use python script to calculate? Could do more readings, changing speed. (bonus? changing shape). (bonus+: using the map as a tally for a false/true positives/negatives graph kinda metric)).
- [ ] Add improvement to system. Integrating multiple sensors (diffrerent distances?), adding a confidence metric using the map as a tally/ some probability?
- [ ] Update TODO list.
- [ ] Delete TODO list.
